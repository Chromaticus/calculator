# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a clean and user-friendly interface.

The HTML provides the structure of the calculator, and the CSS is used for styling. The JavaScript is responsible for handling the user input, performing calculations and displaying the results. This project was an opportunity to practice and demonstrate my skills in the use of basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS and also to create a simple functional tool that is widely used.

The calculator project was a great way to learn how to work with input elements, event listeners and how to manipulate the DOM to change the values of elements and displaying them on the screen. I also learned how to handle basic arithmetic and mathematical calculations with JavaScript.
